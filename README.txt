Field Service Hours Tracker â€” Quick README (simple instructions for iPhone users)

Files in this package:
- field_service_tracker.html  (main calendar + entry UI)
- dashboard.html              (separate page with the service-year bar chart)
- manifest.json               (for PWA install)
- service-worker.js           (small service worker)
- icon-192.png, icon-512.png  (icons)
- README.txt                  (this file)

Quick install on iPhone (simple, no hosting required):
1. Download the ZIP on your iPhone (tap the download link your assistant gives you).
2. Open the Files app and find the ZIP (usually in Downloads).
3. Tap the ZIP to extract it (or long-press and choose 'Uncompress').
4. Inside the extracted folder, tap 'field_service_tracker.html'. It will open a preview. 
   - If it doesn't open in Safari, tap the Share button (square with arrow) and pick 'Open in Safari'.
5. In Safari, tap the Share button again and choose 'Add to Home Screen'.
6. Give it a name like "FS Tracker" and tap Add. The app icon will appear on your Home Screen.
7. Tap the icon anytime to open the tracker. It will run like a simple app.

Notes and important things (keep it simple):
- Your data is saved only on your iPhone (in the browser). If you clear Safari data or uninstall, you may lose data unless you export/backup.
- To back up: use the Export JSON button and save the file to iCloud Drive or email it to yourself.
- For Google Drive backup and full PWA offline features (service worker, background), the app should be hosted on a website (HTTPS). If you want that, I can walk you through hosting on GitHub Pages (easy, free).

If anything is confusing, tell me which step and I will make a screenshot or short video showing exactly what to tap.
